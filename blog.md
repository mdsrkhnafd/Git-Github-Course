# Learn Git and GitHub the Easy Way: A Beginner's Guide

If you're new to coding or just starting to work on real projects, Git can seem confusing. But once you understand the basics, it becomes one of the most powerful tools you'll use every day. This guide will walk you through Git step by step, using simple examples and clear explanations.

---

## üöÄ What Is Git?

Git is a free tool that helps you:

- **Save versions of your code** and keep track of every change.
- **Go back in time** if something breaks or you make a mistake.
- **Work with others** on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.

Think of Git as a smart "undo" and collaboration system for your code.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up Git (First-Time Only)

Before you can start using Git, you need to tell Git who you are. This info gets saved with every change you make, so it's important to set it up properly.

### Step 1: Open the Terminal

You need to use the terminal to enter Git commands.

**If you're using VSCode:**

- Go to the top menu and click:  
  **View > Terminal**

Or use the keyboard shortcut:

- **Ctrl + `** (on Windows or Linux)
- **Cmd + `** (on Mac)

This opens the terminal panel at the bottom of the editor.

**If you're using macOS and not VSCode:**

- Open the built-in **Terminal app**.
- Press **Cmd + Space**, type **Terminal**, and hit **Enter**.

The terminal is where you'll type and run Git commands.

---

### Step 2: Set Your Name and Email

Once the terminal is open, run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name and use the email address you plan to use on GitHub.

---

### What These Commands Do

- `user.name` and `user.email` tell Git who is making each change.
- This information shows up next to each commit.
- The `--global` flag means these settings apply to all Git projects on your computer (you only need to do this once).

---

### Check Your Git Settings

To make sure your info was saved correctly, run:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

This will show your name and email.

To see all Git settings and where they were set from:

```bash
git config --list --show-origin
```

Now you're ready to start using Git in any project!

---

## üßæ Most Used Git Commands (And What They Do)

### Start a New Git Project

```bash
git init
```

This command tells Git to start tracking your project. It creates a hidden `.git` folder inside your project. You won't usually touch this folder, but it's where Git saves all the history and settings.

---

### Check What's Going On

```bash
git status
```

This shows the current state of your files ‚Äî which ones are new, which ones have been changed, and which ones are ready to be saved (committed). It's a command you'll use a lot.

---

### Add Files to Be Saved

Before you save your changes permanently, you need to stage them using:

```bash
git add file.txt
```

This stages the file `file.txt`.

To stage everything in the current folder:

```bash
git add .
```

To stage everything in the entire project (no matter where you are):

```bash
git add -A
```

---

### Save the Changes (Make a Commit)

```bash
git commit -m "your message here"
```

This saves all the staged changes and adds a message so you know what the change was.

Good messages are short and clear, like:

```bash
git commit -m "add login form"
git commit -m "fix footer layout"
```

Avoid unclear messages like:

```bash
git commit -m "stuff"
git commit -m "things"
```

Commit messages help you remember what you did and help others understand your work too.

---

### See Your Project History

```bash
git log
```

This shows all the past commits ‚Äî including who made them, the message, and when.

If you want a shorter version:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This shows one line per commit, so it's easier to scan quickly.

---

## üîÅ How Git Tracks Files (File States Explained)

Each file in Git can be in one of several states:

- **Untracked** ‚Äì Git doesn't know about the file yet.
- **Staged** ‚Äì You've told Git to include the file in the next save (`git add`).
- **Committed** ‚Äì The file has been saved in the project history.
- **Modified** ‚Äì You've changed a file that was already saved.

Understanding these states is helpful when you're figuring out what will be saved and what hasn't yet.

---

## üß™ Try It Yourself: Your First Git Project

Let's go step by step and practice everything.

1. Create a folder called `git-tutorial` and open it in VSCode.
2. Open the terminal (Ctrl + `).
3. Run this to start Git in your project:

```bash
git init
```

4. Create a file:

```bash
echo "Hello Git" > main.txt
```

5. Add the file to the staging area:

```bash
git add main.txt
```

6. Save it with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "add main.txt"
```

7. Add more files:

```bash
echo "New file" > second.txt
git add .
git commit -m "add second.txt"
```

8. See your history:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Now you've made multiple commits and can review your project's history.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Making Changes and Adding New Files

Let's try editing and adding at the same time:

1. Edit `main.txt` and change the text.
2. Create a new folder called `notes`.
3. Inside that folder, create a file: `todo.txt`.
4. Add and commit both changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update main.txt and add todo.txt"
```

This shows how Git handles both modified and new files at the same time.

---

## üß© Using Git Inside VSCode

Instead of using the terminal, you can use the Git GUI built into VSCode.

- Click the Source Control icon in the sidebar (it looks like a branch).
- You'll see file changes, and you can:
  - Stage files by clicking the "+" button
  - Write commit messages in the input box
  - Click the checkmark to commit

This is helpful if you're more comfortable with a visual interface instead of using the terminal.

---

## üß≠ Going Back in Time with Git

Every time you commit, Git saves a unique ID (called a hash). You can use it to go back to that version.

1. See your history:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

2. Copy the hash from a commit.
3. Move to that version:

```bash
git checkout <commit_hash>
```

While in this "detached" state, don't make changes. When you're ready to go back to the main version:

```bash
git checkout main
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Git Tips

### `git add .` vs `git add -A`

- `git add .` adds changes from the current folder only.
- `git add -A` adds changes from the entire project, even from other folders.

To make sure you don't miss anything, use `git add -A`.

---

### Never Touch the `.git` Folder

This folder stores Git's internal data. Do **not**:

- Create folders inside `.git`
- Run `git init` inside it
- Edit or delete files in it

Doing this can break your project and delete your commit history.

---

## üéØ Practice Challenge

1. Create a new folder: `my-git-project`.
2. Open it in VSCode and open the terminal.
3. Start Git:

```bash
git init
```

4. Create a file and write something inside.
5. Add and commit it:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

6. Edit the file, create another one, and repeat the process.
7. Use `git log --oneline` to see what you've done.

Repeat the process to practice. The more you use Git, the more natural it becomes.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Next?

Once you're comfortable with these basics, the next step is to learn:

- **Branches** ‚Äì Work on features without touching the main code.
- **Merging** ‚Äì Combine different branches together.
- **Rebasing** ‚Äì Clean up your history.
- **Fixing conflicts** ‚Äì Handle situations when changes overlap.

That's all coming in the next guide.

_You're doing great ‚Äî Git is your friend now!_ üôå

# Git Branches, Merging, and Rebasing ‚Äî A Simple Guide

Now that you know the basics of Git, it's time to learn how to work on **different tasks or features without breaking your main project**. That's where **branches** come in. You'll also learn how to **merge** and **rebase** changes, which are two ways of bringing branches back together.

---

## üå± What Are Branches?

A Git branch is like a separate copy of your project where you can work without affecting the original. This is helpful when you're adding new features, fixing bugs, or testing ideas.

### Common Branch Commands

```bash
git branch               # List all branches
git branch new-feature  # Create a new branch
git checkout main       # Switch to another branch
git switch main         # Same as checkout (Git 2.23+)
git checkout -b new     # Create and switch in one step
git switch -c new       # Same as above (Git 2.23+)
```

---

## üß™ Example: Creating and Switching Branches

Let's walk through it.

1. Open **VSCode** and create a folder called `git-branches`.
2. Open the terminal:

   - **VSCode:** Click `View > Terminal` or use ` Ctrl + `` (Windows/Linux) or  `Cmd + `` (Mac).
   - **macOS Terminal:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type **Terminal**, and hit Enter.

3. Start Git:

```bash
git init
```

4. Create a file and commit:

```bash
echo "main file" > main-01.txt
git add .
git commit -m "add main-01.txt"
```

5. Do the same for another file:

```bash
echo "another main file" > main-02.txt
git add .
git commit -m "add main-02.txt"
```

6. Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature
```

7. Check current branch:

```bash
git branch
```

8. Add a new file in this branch:

```bash
mkdir features
echo "feature work" > features/feature-01.txt
git add .
git commit -m "add feature-01.txt"
```

9. Switch back to `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Notice that `feature-01.txt` is gone ‚Äî that's because each branch has its own files and changes.

---

## ‚è© Quick Practice: Create a Bugfix Branch

1. Run this to create and switch to a bugfix branch:

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix
```

2. Add and commit a new file:

```bash
mkdir bugfix
echo "bugfix work" > bugfix/file-01.txt
git add .
git commit -m "add bugfix file"
```

3. Switch back to main:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Again, the new file won't appear here. Each branch is its own world.

---

## üîÄ Merging Branches

Merging brings changes from one branch into another.

### 1. Fast-Forward Merge

Happens when the target branch (like `main`) has no changes of its own. Git just moves its pointer forward.

Example:

- You are on the `feature` branch and want to merge `main`:

```bash
git merge main
```

If `main` hasn't changed, this merge is fast and clean.

### 2. Three-Way Merge

Used when **both branches** have made changes. Git creates a new **merge commit** to combine both histories.

Steps:

1. Switch to the branch you want to merge into:

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. Make sure you're on the right branch:

```bash
git branch
```

3. Merge the feature branch into it:

```bash
git merge feature
```

4. See the result:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Look for something like:

```bash
(HEAD -> main, feature)
```

That means both branches point to the same commit.

---

### üß™ Practice: Merge `main` into `bugfix`

1. Switch to `bugfix`:

```bash
git checkout bugfix
```

2. Merge `main` (this will create a merge commit):

```bash
git merge main
```

Git may open a text editor (like Vim or Nano) to confirm the commit message.

#### In VSCode GUI:

- You'll see the message box in the Source Control panel. Just click **Commit**.

#### In Vim:

- Press `i` to edit.
- Press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and hit Enter to save and quit.

#### In Nano:

- Type your message.
- Press `Ctrl+O` then `Enter` to save.
- Press `Ctrl+X` to exit.

3. Now go back to `main` and merge `bugfix`:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge bugfix
```

4. Check history:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

5. Check current status:

```bash
git status
```

---

## üßπ Deleting Branches

Once a branch is merged, you can safely delete it.

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

If it's **not merged yet**, Git will stop you from deleting it by accident.

To force-delete:

```bash
git branch -D branch-name
```

### Example:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -d feature
git branch -d bugfix
```

Create a test branch:

```bash
git checkout -b test
echo "test" > test.txt
git add .
git commit -m "add test file"
```

Now delete it from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -d test  # Git warns it's not merged
git branch -D test  # Force delete
```

---

## üîÅ Why Merge `main` into Feature?

Sometimes your teammates update `main` while you're working on a feature. Merging `main` into your branch helps you:

- **Get the latest updates**
- **Solve conflicts early**
- **Avoid surprises later when merging back**

---

## üìè What Is Rebase?

Rebase is another way to bring changes from one branch into another. But instead of merging, it **moves your commits** and creates a clean, straight timeline.

### When to Use It?

- To make history cleaner.
- **Avoid on shared/public branches** like `main` ‚Äî it changes history and can confuse others.

---

### Rebase Example (Instead of Merging)

1. Create a new project:

```bash
mkdir git-rebase
cd git-rebase
git init
```

2. Repeat the same steps as before ‚Äî make a `main`, `feature`, and `bugfix` branch.

3. In `feature` or `bugfix`, instead of merging:

```bash
git rebase main
```

Now your branch will be updated with `main`'s changes, and your commits will be placed on top.

Compare this to the `git-branches` project. The commit history is **cleaner**, but the result is the same.

Some teams prefer rebase, others prefer merge. At work, you usually follow team rules.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Using VSCode for Branching & Merging

You can do all of this in VSCode without typing commands.

- Use the Source Control panel.
- Click the "..." menu to create branches, switch, and merge.
- When merging, VSCode will often auto-commit for you.
- It's quicker and easier, especially for beginners.

---

## üß† Git Challenge: Branches & Merging

Try this on your own:

1. Create a folder: `my-branch-project`
2. Open it in VSCode and start Git:

```bash
git init
```

3. Add and commit a couple of files in `main`.
4. Create `feature` and `bugfix` branches:

```bash
git checkout -b feature
git checkout -b bugfix
```

5. Add different files in each branch and commit them.
6. Merge `main` into `feature`, then merge `feature` into `main`.
7. Do the same with `bugfix`, but try **rebase** instead of merge.
8. Try deleting the branches.
9. Create a `test` branch, commit something, and practice forced deletion.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Use **branches** to safely work on features.
- Use **merge** to combine branches.
- Use **rebase** to clean up history (only when it's safe).
- Use **VSCode** to manage Git without the terminal if you prefer visuals.

With practice, all of this becomes second nature!

_Keep practicing ‚Äî you're one branch away from mastering Git!_ üåø

# Git Deep Dive: Config, Ignore, Stash, Reset, and Recovery

Now that you're comfortable with the basics of Git and branches, let's explore some **important Git tools and tricks** that will make your work easier and safer. In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Use global and local Git settings
- Ignore files with `.gitignore`
- Stash temporary changes
- Understand HEAD and detached HEAD
- Use reflog to recover lost commits
- Undo and reset changes safely

---

## üîß Git Config (Global vs Local)

When using Git, it's important to tell Git who you are. You can do this **globally** (for all projects) or **locally** (just for one project).

### Global Git Config

To set your name and email globally, open the terminal and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

This will apply to **all Git projects** on your computer.

### Local Git Config

If you want to use a **different name or email in just one project**, you can set it locally:

```bash
git config --local user.name "Another Name"
git config --local user.email "another@email.com"
```

These settings are stored inside the `.git/config` file in your project folder.

You can view local settings with:

```bash
git config --local --list
```

Or open the file `.git/config` in any text editor.

---

### Extra: Customize Default Branch Name

By default, Git uses `main` or `master` as the first branch name. But you can set your own:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch shakeAndBake
```

Now all new Git projects will start with a branch named `shakeAndBake`. It's great for teams who follow specific naming rules.

---

## üö´ Ignoring Files with `.gitignore`

Some files don't belong in your Git history ‚Äî like passwords, log files, or generated files.

Create a `.gitignore` file in your project and add filenames or patterns you want Git to ignore.

Example:

```bash
.env
node_modules/
*.log
```

Git will **not track** these files, and they won't show up in `git status`.

---

### Practice: Try It Yourself

1. Create a project and run:

```bash
git init
```

2. Create a file and commit it:

```bash
echo "hello" > main-01.txt
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

3. Create a `.gitignore` file and add:

```bash
.env
```

4. Create a `.env` file with:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=supersecret
```

5. Run:

```bash
git status
```

You'll see `.env` is ignored ‚Äî it won't be staged or committed.

---

## üëú Git Stash: Save Work for Later

Sometimes you need to switch tasks but don't want to commit unfinished work. `git stash` helps with that.

- Save changes:

```bash
git stash
```

- Save with a message:

```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: fixing button style"
```

- See stash list:

```bash
git stash list
```

- Reapply the last stash and remove it:

```bash
git stash pop
```

- Reapply without removing:

```bash
git stash apply
```

- Apply a specific stash:

```bash
git stash pop stash@{0}
```

Stash only works if your project has at least one commit. Also, it only saves **tracked files**.

---

## üìç Understanding HEAD and Detached HEAD

### HEAD

HEAD is a pointer that shows **where you are** in your Git history. Usually, it points to the latest commit on your current branch.

When you make a new commit, HEAD moves forward.

### Detached HEAD

If you checkout a **specific commit** (instead of a branch), HEAD gets "detached."

Example:

```bash
git checkout abc123
```

Now you're not on any branch. Any commits made now will not belong to a branch ‚Äî they're "orphaned."

To save your work:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

That creates a new branch and attaches HEAD to it again.

üí° Use `git log` or `git show <hash>` to view a commit instead of checking it out, so you avoid detached HEAD mode.

---

## üß≠ Git Reflog: Recover Lost Commits

Made a mistake? Deleted a branch? Don't panic ‚Äî `git reflog` can help.

```bash
git reflog
```

This shows **everything** Git has done ‚Äî every branch switch, commit, reset, etc. You can use it to recover lost commits:

1. Copy the commit hash from `git reflog`.
2. Checkout that commit or branch:

```bash
git checkout <hash>
git checkout -b recovered-branch
```

Think of `git log` as your official history, and `git reflog` as your full activity log.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Git Reset: Undoing Commits

Git reset helps you **undo commits** or **unstage files**.

### Undo the Last Commit (keep changes staged):

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Undo and discard changes completely:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Reset to a specific commit:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

### Unstage a file:

```bash
git reset filename.txt
```

### Unstage all files:

```bash
git reset
```

üí° HEAD~1 means "one commit before the current one". HEAD~2 would mean "two commits back".

---

## üîô Git Restore and Checkout

To undo changes **you haven't staged yet**, use:

```bash
git restore filename.txt
```

To discard all unstaged changes:

```bash
git restore .
```

Or use the older version:

```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt
git checkout .
```

Both do the same, but `git restore` is newer and easier to read.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Untracked Files

Untracked files are files Git doesn't know about (you haven't added them).

### Preview what will be deleted:

```bash
git clean -dn
```

### Actually delete untracked files:

```bash
git clean -df
```

Be careful ‚Äî this **cannot be undone**.

---

## üî• Deleting Unmerged Branches

If you try to delete a branch that hasn't been merged:

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

Git will stop you.

To force delete:

```bash
git branch -D branch-name
```

The commits are still saved (for a while) and can be recovered using `git reflog`.

Tips:

- Merge important changes before deleting
- Create a backup branch if unsure
- Only use `-D` when you're 100% ready

---

## üß† Git Challenge: Practice Config, Ignore, Stash & Recovery

Try these steps to put everything together:

1.  Create a folder `my-git-tools`
2.  Open in VSCode, open terminal
3.  Run:

```bash
git init
```

4.  Set local name and email:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Local Name"
git config user.email "your@local.email"
```

5.  Add and commit 3 files (`main-01.txt`, `main-02.txt`, `main-03.txt`)
6.  Create `.gitignore` with:

```bash
temp\*.md
```

7.  Create `.temp-1.md` and `.temp-99.md`
8.  Run:

```bash
git status
```

9.  Modify `main-01.txt` but don't commit
10. Stash your changes:

```bash
git stash push -m "work in progress"
```

11. Check stashes:

```bash
git stash list
```

12. Apply the stash:

```bash
git stash pop
```

13. View commit log:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

14. Copy a hash and check it out:

```bash
git checkout <hash>
```

15. Make a change and commit
16. Realize you're in detached HEAD, save it:

```bash
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```

17. Switch back to `main`

18. View reflog:

```bash
git reflog
```

19. Make 2 commits

20. Run:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

21. Edit and re-commit

22. Run:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

23. Confirm changes are gone

24. Stage a change, then unstage it:

```bash
git restore --staged filename.txt
```

25. Make more changes, discard them:

```bash
git restore .
```

26. Create `temp.txt` and preview clean:

```bash
git clean -dn
```

27. Delete it:

```bash
git clean -df
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Use **local config** when working in different teams/projects
- Use **.gitignore** to keep sensitive and messy files out of Git
- Use **stash** to save work temporarily without committing
- Understand **HEAD** and **reflog** to recover lost work
- Use **reset, restore, and clean** to undo, fix, or clean things up

These are the everyday tools real developers use to avoid mistakes and recover fast when something goes wrong.

# Git Merge Conflicts, Rebase, Squash, and Cherry-Pick: Explained Simply

As your Git projects grow, you'll start working with multiple branches ‚Äî and sooner or later, you'll run into **merge conflicts**. Don't panic. Conflicts are normal and fixable. In this guide, we'll explain merge conflicts, how to fix them, and how to work with powerful tools like rebase, squash, and cherry-pick.

---

## üí• What Is a Merge Conflict?

A **merge conflict** happens when Git can't figure out how to combine changes from two branches. This usually occurs when:

- Two branches changed the **same line** in a file
- One branch **deleted** a file while the other **edited** it
- A file is **renamed** differently in two branches
- One branch creates a **file**, the other creates a **folder** with the same name
- Binary files (like images) are edited differently in each branch

When this happens, Git **pauses** the merge and marks the file as conflicted ‚Äî waiting for you to fix it.

---

## üîÑ Rebase vs Merge: What's the Difference?

Both `git merge` and `git rebase` are ways to combine branches, but they behave differently.

### üëâ Merge (`git merge main` from `feature` branch)

- Keeps the full branch history
- Creates a new **merge commit**
- Keeps the context of both branches

How it works:

1. Finds the common base commit
2. Combines the new changes from both branches
3. Creates a merge commit

### üëâ Rebase (`git rebase main` from `feature` branch)

- Rewrites history
- No merge commit ‚Äî creates a **clean, linear** history
- Moves your changes on top of the other branch

How it works:

1. Temporarily removes your changes
2. Updates your branch to match `main`
3. Re-applies your changes one by one

üí° Use rebase when you want a cleaner history. Use merge when you want to preserve the full story.

---

## üß® Merge Conflicts During Rebase

Rebase also runs into conflicts ‚Äî especially if the changes in the base branch touch the same lines you've changed.

What happens:

- Git stops and tells you which files are in conflict
- You must fix the file(s)
- Then run:

```bash
git add filename.txt
git rebase --continue
```

You can also cancel a rebase:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

---

## üß∫ Squashing Commits

Sometimes you make lots of small commits while working on a feature. Instead of merging all of them into `main`, you can **squash** them into one commit.

### 1. Squash with merge:

```bash
git merge --squash feature
git commit -m "add full feature in one commit"
```

### 2. Squash with interactive rebase:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

This opens a list of your last `n` commits in a text editor. Change `pick` to `squash` or `s` for the commits you want to combine.

Follow the prompts to write the new, single commit message.

---

## üçí Cherry-Pick

Cherry-pick means **copying a single commit** from one branch and adding it to another.

This is useful when:

- You want one small change from another branch
- You don't want to merge the whole branch

### Steps:

1. Find the commit hash:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

2. Switch to the target branch:

```bash
git checkout cherry-target
```

3. Apply the commit:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

4. If there are conflicts, resolve them, then run:

```bash
git add .
git cherry-pick --continue
```

You can cherry-pick multiple commits too:

```bash
git cherry-pick a1b2c3..f6g7h8
```

## üß† Git Challenge: Practice Merge Conflicts, Rebase & Cherry-Pick

Try this exercise to put everything together:

### üîß Setup

1. Create a new folder: `git-merge-rebase-practice`
2. Open it in VSCode
3. Open the terminal:

```bash
View > Terminal
or Ctrl + ` (Windows/Linux)
    Cmd + ` (Mac)
```

4. Initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

5. Create and commit a file:

```bash
echo "Hello from main" > main.txt
git add .
git commit -m "main.txt initial commit"
```

---

### üîÄ Create Conflict

1. Create a branch and switch to it:

```bash
git checkout -b feature
```

2. Modify `main.txt` (same line), commit:

```bash
echo "Feature change" > main.txt
git add .
git commit -m "update main.txt in feature"
```

3. Create another file:

```bash
echo "New feature file" > feature-1.txt
git add .
git commit -m "add feature-1.txt"
```

4. Switch back to `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
```

5. Modify the same line in `main.txt` differently, commit:

```bash
echo "Main branch change" > main.txt
git add .
git commit -m "conflicting change in main"
```

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è Trigger a Merge Conflict

1. Merge `main` into `feature`:

```bash
git checkout feature
git merge main
```

Git will stop and show a conflict in `main.txt`.

2. Open `main.txt`, you'll see:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
Feature change
=======
Main branch change
>>>>>>> main
```

3. Pick the correct version or combine both. Then save and exit.

4. Stage the file:

```bash
git add main.txt
```

5. Finish the merge:

```bash
git commit
```

---

### üßº Squash the Commits

1. Switch to `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. Squash merge `feature`:

```bash
git merge --squash feature
git commit -m "squashed feature changes"
```

---

### üîÅ Practice Rebase

1. Reset to the commit before merge:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

2. Switch to `feature`, then rebase:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

Resolve the conflict as before. Then run:

```bash
git add main.txt
git rebase --continue
```

---

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Interactive Rebase

Make a few small commits:

```bash
echo "line1" >> notes.txt
git add . && git commit -m "add line1"
echo "line2" >> notes.txt
git add . && git commit -m "add line2"
```

Now run:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

Change `pick` to `squash` for the second commit. Save and confirm the new message.

---

### üçí Cherry-Pick a Commit

1. Switch to `feature` and make a new change:

```bash
echo "unique update" > cherry.txt
git add .
git commit -m "special change to cherry-pick"
```

2. Copy the commit hash:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

3. Switch to `cherry-target`:

```bash
git checkout -b cherry-target
```

4. Cherry-pick the commit:

```bash
git cherry-pick <hash>
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Conflicts happen when two branches change the same thing.
- Rebase creates a cleaner history, but merge preserves the original timeline.
- Squash helps you combine messy commits into one.
- Cherry-pick lets you copy just one change without merging everything.

With these tools, you're ready to work like a real Git pro ‚Äî even when things get messy.

# GitHub for Beginners: Remotes, SSH, Pull Requests & Collaboration

You've learned how to use Git locally. Now let's take things to the next level ‚Äî working with GitHub! GitHub is a platform that helps you **host your code online**, **collaborate with others**, and **track changes** as a team.

---

## üåê What is GitHub?

GitHub is the world's largest development platform where:

- You can **host your Git repositories**
- Collaborate with teammates or open-source communities
- Share code, track issues, and submit pull requests (PRs)

---

## üîó Working with Remotes

When you connect your local Git project to GitHub, you set up a **remote**. GitHub becomes the online version of your project.

Here are the essential Git remote commands:

### 1. Add a Remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

- `origin` is a nickname for the remote GitHub repo.
- The URL is the repo's SSH or HTTPS link.

---

### 2. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

- Sends your local commits to GitHub.
- Use `-u` to set tracking so future pushes don't need branch names.

For feature branches:

```bash
git push -u origin feature-name
```

---

### 3. Fetch Updates (No Merge)

```bash
git fetch
```

- Downloads new data from GitHub but **does not change** your files.
- Use when you want to review changes before applying them.

---

### 4. Pull Changes (Fetch + Merge)

```bash
git pull
```

- Updates your branch with the latest changes from GitHub.
- Combines `fetch` + `merge`.

---

### 5. Clone a Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

- Makes a local copy of a GitHub repo.
- Sets up remotes automatically.

---

## üîê Setting Up SSH with GitHub

Using SSH is a secure and convenient way to connect to GitHub without typing your password every time.

### Steps:

1. Check for existing SSH keys:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

2. Generate a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
```

3. Copy the public key:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

4. Go to GitHub:

   - **Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key**
   - Paste and save

5. Test connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you get a success message, you're all set!

---

### Optional: SSH Config File

If needed, add a config file:

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

Example config:

```bash
Host github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Then run:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

---

## üöÄ First GitHub Project

1. Create a new folder locally and initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

2. Add a file and commit:

```bash
echo "console.log('hello')" > app.js
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

3. On GitHub, create a new repository.

4. Connect and push:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

5. Make more changes locally and push again:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "second commit"
git push
```

---

## üß† Pull Requests (PRs)

Pull Requests let you share changes with others and ask for review.

1. Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-xyz
```

2. Make changes and commit.

3. Push the branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin feature-xyz
```

4. Go to GitHub, click "Compare & pull request".

5. Add a description and create the PR.

Now collaborators can review, suggest changes, or approve it for merging.

---

## üß™ Practice PR with TICKET-22 Branch

1. Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b TICKET-22
```

2. Edit files:

```bash
echo "hello people" >> main-01.txt
echo "hello from ticket-22" > hello.js
echo "app is running..." > app.js
```

3. Make 2 commits:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "TICKET-22 make changes"
git commit -am "TICKET-22 update app.js"
```

4. Merge `main` into `TICKET-22`:

```bash
git merge main
```

5. Push to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin TICKET-22
```

6. Open a pull request.

---

## üí¨ What If You See "Already up to date"?

That means the branches don't have new changes to merge. Just continue working or open a PR if your branch is ready to merge.

---

## üîÑ Understanding Remotes and Remote-Tracking Branches

### What is a Remote?

A remote is a version of your project stored online (like GitHub).

### What is a Remote-Tracking Branch?

When you `fetch`, Git updates your local copy of the remote branch (like `origin/main`). This lets you see what changed without modifying your current branch.

---

### Check All Branches (Local + Remote)

```bash
git branch -a
```

You'll see something like:

```bash
main
remotes/origin/main
remotes/origin/TICKET-22
```

---

## ‚ö° Common Remote Actions

### Fetch:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

- Downloads updates but doesn't merge.

### Pull:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

- Downloads and merges changes into your current branch.

### Push:

```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

- Sends your local commits to GitHub.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Interactive Rebase and Force Push

Let's say you want to squash commits in your branch:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

Mark some commits as `squash`, save, and follow the prompts.

Then push:

```bash
git push -f
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Use force push carefully ‚Äî it rewrites history and can overwrite others' work if you're sharing the branch.

---

## üçí Cherry-Picking Commits from Another Branch

Cherry-pick lets you copy a single commit from one branch to another.

### Steps:

1. Copy commit hash from `git log`
2. Switch to your target branch:

```bash
git checkout checkout
```

3. Cherry-pick the commit:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

If Git can't find the commit:

- Run:

```bash
git fetch
```

- Try again

Cherry-pick is useful when you want one feature or fix from another branch without merging the whole thing.

---

## üß† GitHub Collaboration Challenge

1. Create a GitHub repo and clone it in 3 folders: `dev1`, `dev2`, `dev3`

### In `dev1`:

- Create branch `TICKET-11`
- Change `app.js`, commit
- Merge `main` into it
- Push to GitHub
- Create PR ‚Üí Merge using **merge**

### In `dev2`:

- Create branch `TICKET-22`
- Make 2 commits to `app.js`
- Push to GitHub
- Create PR ‚Üí Merge using **merge**

### In `dev3`:

- Create branch `TICKET-33`
- Make 3 commits
- Use interactive rebase to squash
- Rebase onto `main`
- Force push to GitHub
- Create PR ‚Üí Merge using **rebase**

---

## üçí Advanced Cherry-Pick Practice

1. Clone the repo into `dev4` and `dev5`

### In `dev4`:

- Create branch `feature`
- Add `feature.txt`
- Commit and push

### In `dev5`:

- Create branch `checkout`
- Add `checkout.txt`
- Commit

Try to cherry-pick `feature.txt` commit ‚Üí you'll get an error

Fix it with:

```bash
git fetch
```

Then:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

Now the commit can be applied.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Use `git remote` and `push/pull/fetch/clone` to connect local and remote repos
- Use SSH for secure communication with GitHub
- Use branches + PRs for team collaboration
- Use `rebase` to clean up commit history
- Use `cherry-pick` to bring over specific changes
- Use force-push only when you know what you're doing

---
